    "### Goal of this workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, you are going to explore a computational model that makes decisions using two distinct reinforcement-learning strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these is an agent that learns the value of actions in the environment solely by observing their associated _rewards_ and _punishments_. This strategy, which resembles Skinner's operant conditioning principles, is extremely efficient and has virtually no deliberation by the agent. It simply repeats what worked in the past, and avoids what did not. We think of this type of decision making as more-or-less *habitual*.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, humans, and other animals, often make more sophisticated decisions, using the structure of the environment to their advantage. This was shown famously by Edward Tolman. He trained mice to find a reward in a simple maze, always starting them from the same location. Of course, these mice quickly found the most efficient way to the reward. This result is, of course, easily explainable with operant conditioning. However, when Tolman placed his rats in another arm of the maze, he found that they were still very good at walking towards the rewarded location. This suggests that the rats formed a _cognitive map_ of the task, an internal representation of the structure of the maze, and that they used this to plan towards their goal. This type of decision making can be thought of as *goal-directed* or *deliberative*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans also form cognitive maps of their environment, and they use these to plan towards their goals. Some of these cognitive maps can be of actual physical space (such as when planning your route home), but cognitive maps can be very abstract as well (for example, of your social network!)."

In the first (this notebook), you will learn about the task, some of the basic building blocks of reinforcement-learning models, and you will simulate behavior of an agent that acts purely with the habitual decision-making strategy. In the second, you will add the goal-directed decision-making strategy to this code, and you will learn how let the agent act according to a _mixture_ of these two 'systems'. In the third section, we will teach you how to fit the model's parameters to data. We have tried our best to structure the coding assignments so that you start with very small tasks, and then work your way to a real, working, simulation of how humans might perform in a psychological experiment.\n",

    "# Section 1: the paradigm, value-based choice, and model-free reinforcement learning\n",
    "## The two-step task\n",
    "We are going to simulate reinforcement-learning perform a variant of popular paradigm known as the 'two-step' task. In this task, participants have to make repeated decisions in order to receive a reward. To make the task more fun for our participants, we have embedded the task in a space travel setting! On each trial of the task participants choose one spaceship from a pair of spaceships. The chosen spaceship then takes the participant to either a red or a purple planet. There they encounter an alien. If the participant interacts with the alien, there is chance that they will receive a reward in the form of space treasure!\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, there are two pairs of spaceships that each appear in their own 'first-stage' state. For each pair, one spaceship will always transition to the red planet, and the other always to the purple planet. Below is a schematic of this structure, in _cursive_ are the variables we will use to keep track of the different states (s1 and s2) and values for actions (Qmf1 and Qmf2):\n",

    "![Task_structure](../Figures/task_structure_text.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "_Stimuli adapted from Decker et al. 2016_\n",
    "\n",
    "So each trial starts with seeing one of the two pairs of spaceships (either in the top left or top right panel). In each pair, participant have the opportunity to go to the red or the purple planet. The dark blue and orange spaceships always travel to the red planet, while the green and light blue spaceship always go to the purple planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "After selecting an alien, the participant either recieves a reward or it does not. This is determined by the current _reward probability_ of each alien. If this probability is high, the alien is likely to deliver a reward, if it is low, the alien is unlikely to deliver a reward. For each of the two aliens, this reward probability changes over time, independently from the other alien's reward probability. This means that participants need to continually learn which planet has the best alien! You can see an example of reward probabilities for each alien across 200 trials of the task. Note that the reward probabilities 'drift' between 0% and 100%.\n",

    "## Two reinforcement-learning strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "The neat thing about the two-step task is that it lets researchers dissociate between more habitual and more goal-directed decision-making strategies. We can do so by using tools from reinforcement learning. Specifically, a wealth of research over the last decade suggests that these forms of decision making are described well by ***model-free*** and ***model-based*** reinforcement learning, respectively (for a short introductory piece, see Drummond & Niv, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model-free reinforcement learning\n",
    "A model-free decision maker simply associates the actions it took with the rewards they yielded. It increases the likelihood of choosing actions that led to reward, and decreases the likelihood of choosing actions that led to no reward. In other words, it performs trial-and-error learning. In the two-step task above, this has some interesting implications for how a model-free learner chooses its actions based on what happened on the previous trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine that a trial starts with the  spaceship pair on the top left in the image above, and that the agent chooses the dark blue spaceship. Therefore, they will transition to red planet. Now let's say that here they receive a reward. The question is how this affects their choice on the next trial. It turns out that this completely depends on which first-stage 'starting state' they encounter on this next trial. There are two possibilities: either they start in the same (top-left) state, or in the other (top-right) state (this is randomly chosen). If the model-free agent starts in the same state as on the previous trial, they will see the same dark-blue spaceship again. Because they have associated the dark-blue spaceship with the reward on the previous trial, the model-free agent will  be more likely to choose this spaceship again! However, if the model-free agent starts in the other starting state, the action chosen on the previous trial (the dark blue spaceship) is not available (you can verify this in the figure above). The outcomes on the previous trial did not involve any of the currently available actions. Therefore, the outcomes on the previous trial do not affect the choices on the current trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, model-free learners do not generalize experiences between starting states. Because model-free learners simply repeat what worked before, and avoid what didn't, anything learned from one starting state only affects their choice in that same starting state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model-based reinforcement learning\n",
    "Goal-directed control can be modeled using model-based reinforcement learning. The key characteristic of a model-based decision maker is that they use the structure of the environment to _plan towards goals_. In other words, they use their knowledge of how the spaceships transition to planets to infer the expected value of each spaceship. You can think of this in terms of generalization: a model-based learner will view the dark blue and orange spaceships as the same option, and the green and light blue as the same too, because these spaceships lead towards the same planets!\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a model-based agent evaluates each spaceship in terms of its consequences, and therefore it is able to transfer experiences obtained after one pair of spaceships to the other pair. In the example above this would mean that a model-based agent would not only be more likely to choose the dark-blue spaceship in the same starting state, but also the orange spaceship in the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plotting the behavior of model-based and model-free agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure below, we have plotted the behavioral profiles of a model-free (left panel) and a model-based agent (right panel). These graphs depict the probability that the agent revisits the same planet as on the previous trial ('stay' probability) as a function of (1) whether or not a reward was received on that trial and (2) whether the starting state is the same as on the previous trial. As you can see, the model-based agent is unaffected by which first-stage state it encounters (right panel). It simply chooses to go to a planet if it earned reward there on the previous trial, regardless of whether the starting state is the same. The model-free learner, on the other hand, is only more likely to revisit the same second-stage state if it encounters the same pair of spaceships.\n",

    "\n",
    "Model-free reinforcement-learning agents update their estimates of how good actions are (Q-values) after they observe what kind of outcomes these actions yield. _They do so after each choice._ In model-free reinforcement-learning, an agent figures out how much to update a given action value after choosing it by computing a _reward prediction error_. The reward prediction is the difference between what the agent expected to happen (i.e., the Q-value of the chosen action), and what actually occurred. This latter component consists of (1) the actual, immediate, reward the agent earns ($r$), and (2) how much reward it estimates to receive in the future ($Q'$). So the prediction error can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Large PE = (r + Q') - Q(a_{chosen})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the terms in the brackets on the left represents what was _observed_ and the right term represents what was _expected_. So this difference represents some form of surprise! It then uses this prediction error to update the value of the chosen action, but only by a small amount. This small amount is also know as the _learning rate_ ($\\alpha$). It dictates how much of the PE gets added to the current Q-value of the chosen action:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Large Q(a_{chosen}) \\leftarrow Q(a_{chosen})+\\alpha PE$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you are going to write this temporal difference rule in a new function below. The function accepts a learning rate (<code>alpha</code>), the Q-value of the chosen action (<code>Q_chosen</code>), and the prediction error (<code>PE</code>). It then spits out an updated version of the Q-value of the chosen action (<code>Q_chosen_updated</code>). \n"

    "\n",
    "The two-step task consists of, uhh, two 'steps'. The first occurs after a spaceship is chosen and the planet is visited. The second step occurs after the alien gets selected, and the reward is observed. Reinforcement-learning agents update their values after each step, and so in this task they compute two prediction errors (<code>pe_1</code> and <code>pe_2</code>).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first prediction error, after the spaceship choice, the immediate reward is zero ($r=0$). After all, no reward is observed after this choice. However, there is some estimate of _future_ reward as given by the estimated reward probability of the encountered alien.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second prediction error, the reward is identical to whatever was observed (either 1 or 0, depending on what the alien delivers). Here, because there are no more future states in the trial, the estimate of future reward (<code>Q_prime</code>) is zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short: the updates happening in the task are actually not that complex (it's true!), both of them effectively contain two terms. You need to keep this in mind when you complete the script below. Among other things, you will write code that computes prediction errors for each trial, and use these in your temporal difference update function (<code>td_rule</code>).\n",
    "\n",
    "We realize it is a little bit counterintuitive to think that the agent _chooses_ an alien after transitioning to the planet. After all, there is only one alien per second-stage state (planet). However, it is important for the model to compute two separate prediction errors, for reasons we will see in the next second part of the workshop.\n"

    "#### Some extensions of reinforcement-learning that we will not be considering here\n",
    "\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, prediction errors on a trial are important not just for the current trial and action, but they are actually used to update all previous actions too. Often, computational models attenuate the degree to which prior actions are updated by the current prediction with a 'eligbility trace decay' parameter $\\lambda$ (lambda) (between 0 and 1). (There's no need to remember this term now). In short, the longer ago an action took place, the less it is affected by the current prediction error (it is discounted by $\\lambda^t$, with _t_ the number of steps ago).\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer scientists also often discount expected future reward with the use of a discounting parameter $\\gamma$ (gamma). That is, when computing the prediction error, they multiply the expectation of future reward by this parameter. From a psychologists perspective, this makes a lot of sense! We know that humans engage in temporal discounting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, however, we will keep things simple, and we will not either $\\gamma$ or $\\lambda$. We will not discount the expectation of future reward, and all actions that happened before the prediction error was computed will be updated in the same way. (So, on each trial this means that after the first prediction error one action value is updated, and after the second two prediction errors are updated.)\n",
