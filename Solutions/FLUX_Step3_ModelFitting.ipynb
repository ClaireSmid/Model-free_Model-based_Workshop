    "### Workshop Step 3: Goal and Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, you successfully implemented a  model that could perform the two-step task in using either model-free control, model-based control, or a _mixture_ of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason research have developed these mixture models, is to use them to explain human behavior on these task. In order to do that, you need to first recruit a bunch of participants to perform a task like the one we just described. Then, you can fit the computational model to each participant's data. This results in a set of values for each parameter in the model (i.e., $w$, $\\alpha$, $\\beta$), that best describe the data. In other words, you can use model-fitting to infer _how_ model-based a participant was, _how_ high their learning rate was, and _how_ 'greedy' (high inverse temperature) or _how_ 'explorative' (low inverse temperature) they where.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most computational modeling papers rely on techniques like this. For example, the authors may want to investigate differences in behavioral processes between children, adolescents and adults, estimating these with their computational model. Other papers use within-subject manipulation of particular variables (such as cognitive load), and then use model fitting to estimate the effect of this manipulation on the parameter of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we don't have data for the current task quite yet. This is partly because this particular task is brand new! Therefore, we can't fit the model to behavioral data. So, we are going to fit the model to simulated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may think that's a little bit silly: if we already know the parameter values used when simulating behavior, why would we want to then fit the model back to this data? We do this because this allows us to get an insight into how _recoverable_ parameter values are. In other words, if we give each parameter a certain value, then how well can we recover those values (get the same values back) using our model-fitting technique? \n",
    "\n",
    "#### So what will we do?\n",
    "First, we will just use the exact same mixture model as in the previous section to simulate an agent with parameter values we define. Next we will _fit_ this data to a version of the model that will find the best corresponding parameter settings for this participant. Then, we can see how similar the values we put in are to the values we get out. That's **parameter recovery!**"

    "## How is model-fitting different from generating data?\n",
    "So far in this workshop, we have generated a lot of data with the models you coded up. In many of the exercises, you changed the values of the parameters that determine this behavior, such as the learning rate (or how quickly agents learn from rewards), the inverse temperature (how greedy or explorative agents are), and the model-free model-based mixing weight (which dictates how much the participants apply their knowledge of the underlying structure). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are going to discuss how we can extract these parameters from behavioral data, _without knowing beforehand how quickly people learn, how much they might exploit, and how much they rely or don't rely on the task structure during decision making_. To this end, we are first going to explain some of the tricks scientists use to fit their model to real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The loglikelihood function\n",
    "In order to find the best-fitting parameter values for a given participant, we need to be able to quantify how well a given set of parameter values (in our case, a triplet of values for $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $w$ for each participants) describes their behavior. If we have such a function, one that puts a number on the quality of this description, the only thing we then need to do is to _maximize_ it. That is, we need to find the set of values that gives us the highest possible score on this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, computational psychologists aim to maximize the _likelihood_ of the data given the model. The likelihood is a simple probability: $L = P(data|model)$. This describes the probability that you would see this data under a given model. In our case, we can write down this likelihood function a bit more precisely: $L = P(behavior|\\alpha,\\beta,w)$. That is, it is the probability you would see the behavior, given certain values of $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $w$. So, now we only need to find the set of values for these three parameters that maximize $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our model, this likelihood is simply equal to the probability that the participant made the choices given the parameter values. This is great, because we already have a way to compute the probability of each, namely with our softmax function. Therefore, in our likelihood function, we are going to store the probability of each choice that was actually made (as computed by softmax), and then compute the likelihood of all choices made by an agent on the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may remember, the probability of a series of independent events is equal to the product of the probabilities of each individual event. Because these probabilities will never be larger than 1, the likelihood of a series of choices is bound to be a very small number (especially when the number of trials is high!). Unfortunately, computers do not do too well with representing very small numbers (this is called point underflow). Therefore, we are going to again use a clever trick and compute the log-transformed likelihood. Because the log-transformation of a product is the sum of the log-transformation of the individual components of a product ($log(A\\cdot B) = log(A) + log(B)$, we can avoid underflow by computing the log-likelihood instead of the likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in our case, the log-likelihood is the sum of the log probabilities of each choice under the given model. Our goal is to find the parameter values (alpha, beta, w) where the log-likelihood is _maximized_, so where the probabilities for the actual choices were the highest. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to read more about the loglikelihood in a fun blogpost, you can find one here: https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2017/08/13/softmax-and-the-negative-log-likelihood/\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we got that out of the way, let's take a look at the log-likelihood function!\n",
    "\n",
    "We have written it out for you below, and as you will see, it looks very much like our previous models, with 2 small (but very important changes):\n",
    "- The parameters alpha, beta and w are now entered into the function as part of x (alpha = x[0], beta = x[1], w = x[2]). we do this so it makes it easier to use the function elsewhere, and also it reduces human error! (We often forget all of the variables we are working with...)\n",
    "- It outputs only one variable: the negative log-likelihood, summed over trials, as you'll see at the end (note that because it's summed over trials, this means that with higher trial numbers, the log-likelihood also increases)\n",

    "What we will try to do here is as follows: \n",
    "1. We will simulate choice behavior for one agent, according to the values we specify at the top of the cell below\n",
    "2. we will use an _optimizer_ to search through the _parameter space_ (which is essentially different combinations of values for $alpha$, $beta$ and $w$) to find the combination of parameters that provide the best (the smallest) negative log-likelihood, which means that the model was able to predict the agent's choices well with these parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we jump in, let's briefly talk about optimizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizers are algorithms that allow you to _optimize_, most often to _minimize_, a function. The optimizer will use the log-likelihood function that we wrote out above, and along with the behavior of a participant, find the best parameter settings that minimize the log-likelihood for this participant. So, it will tell us the values for alpha, beta and w, that it thought the participant's behavior could best be explained by. Isn't that exciting! Note that the optimizer wants to minimize the function, but we want to maximize the loglikelihood. This may seem like a problem at first, but we solve it by calculating the negative log-likelihood: minimizing the negative log-likelhood is the same as maximizing the log-likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is a form of a parameter recovery analysis. Because we know what values of alpha, beta and w we are putting into the model, we also know what their _optimal_ values should be: identical to the ones we used to generate the data. In essence, we are testing how well our model-fitting technique works.\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>Before you run the function below, take a look at the help() entry for the optimizer function by running the cell below. If you scroll all the way to the bottom of the help() output in the cell, you can find some examples of using the optimizer on data. While this might look complicated, you can see how we applied this to our model below, and that it's actually quite straightforward to run!"

    "Before we say goodbye, here are a few things to keep in mind about how to go forward with model-fitting in general, and fitting data for this type in particular. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because we wanted to make this an accessible workshop, we have really oversimplified a lot of the code used to simulate behavior and to fit the data. When we fit these models, we include parameter values that account for a host of other things, such as participants being prone to hit the same key regardless of the outcomes in the task, and we also may include free parameters for future reward discounting and the decay of the eligibility of prior actions for current updates, as we briefly talked about in Step 1 of the workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, a lot of computational modelers have stopped to find the maximum likelihood, but rather the maximum _posterior probabiity_. Derived from Bayes theorem, this probability does not just reflect the likelihood of the data under a model but also the probability of that model per se. We have found that this provides superior fits to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So as a cautionary warning, it is good to keep in mind that for best practices of computational modeling of behavioral data, some more work is involved. To keep things simple in the workshop today we therefore had to cut some corners. We believe that this was most likely to benefit you, especially if you were unfamiliar with computational modeling. However, this also means that if you think this kind of work is for you, there is still a lot to learn. We hope you are excited about that! \n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to start would be to watch David Silver's introduction to reinforcement learning (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0link link also in Step 1 script), where he goes over the basics of reinforcement learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the paper \"Ten Simple rules for the computational modeling of behavioral data\" by Rober Wilson and Anne Collins is a great overview of good practices for computational modeling: https://elifesciences.org/articles/49547\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope you enjoyed the workshop and it was our goal to show you that, even though this stuff seems daunting from the outset, understanding is often just few headscratches away.\n"
